Meeting Notes:
We will start koding our problems individually till next meeting on 09.10.2024, and present it to each other.

Alexander talked about a problem he encountered with downloading the data from yahoo finance for problem 2.
Could download in JSON file.

-> Ask TA for help

Prior to meeting, Percy introduced his plan for problem 4 through text messaging:
Plan for evoAI:

Lære meg Taxi-v3 environment, bli kjent: https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/taxi/#taxi (1 uke)
Visualisere grid (tror det er enkelt, ser det er flere som har gjort de tidligere) (1uke)
Lære eg basic Q-learning algo, og implementere det til Taxi-v3 (2uker)
Tune hyperparametere som LR, discount factor og exploration strategy. (1uke)
Evaluere resultatene og plotte rewards over tid. og sammenligne performance med random vs heuristic-based policy
Så prøve andre RL algoritmer som SARSA, DEPP Q-Networks, policy gradient methods, evt andre (2 uker)
Lage rapport(1uke)

During the meeting Percy mentioned that he found a lot of material on similar problems and that implementing the problem should go well.
If it went as planned Percy could help with the other problems.

Christer-Daniel showed of a plan for how to solve problem 3
