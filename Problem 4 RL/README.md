To run this code is very straight forward. Remember to install and import all the packages. They are all at the first cell.

You can comment or remove the table_baselines3 import if you dont feel like downloading it. it is just for the PPO at the last cell.


For this task I implemented Q-learning, SARSA and PPO.
