The "taxi_final_version.ipynb"-file is the one you should look at, just ignore the "taxi.ipynb"

To run this code is very straight forward. Remember to install and import all the packages. They are all at the first cell.

You can comment or remove the table_baselines3 import if you dont feel like downloading it. it is just for the PPO at the last cell.


For this task I implemented Q-learning, SARSA and PPO.
