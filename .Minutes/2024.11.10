Meeting Notes:

Update on problem 2

Having problems with an over performing task 2
Improvement from task 1-5 is visible, except task 2 which is for some reason we have yet to figure out over performing
All problems have been slow to compute usually taking 10s of minutes, but figured out the problem
Was using a randomization method that was taking a lot of computational time and power, and replaced with a more performant method 
both in fitness (due to being based in optimizing for solution problem rather than random) and computational time / power

Update on problem 3

Working implementations of ACO and PSO for VRPTW solomon c101 have been made and uploaded to the github
Different logic has been used for vehicle assignement on ACO and PSO
ACO tries to use all allow vehicles
PSO tries to use as few vehicles as possible
Might rewrite so both uses same logic

Update on problem 4

Everything done except deepq which is optional and having problems with it

Done with all parts except 5
