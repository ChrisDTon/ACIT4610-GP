Agenda:
Present coding progress on each of the problems, discuss and teach each other, and ask for help from the rest of the group if you need it or met any problems





Meeting Notes:

Update on problem 2

Datasets:
- Found datasets from yahoo finance, but had to use their api to extract the data. Convertet the data from json to csv. 
- Reformatted the csv file to contain onlt monthly returns.
- Made a covariance matrix based on all the monthly returns of each stock. 

Further tasks:
- Implement basic EP for maximizing expected return.


Update on problem 3
Lecture on swarm was moved to 11.10.2024, and so Christer-Daniel has yet to comprehend how PSO and ACO properly works, and implementing them will be put off till next week.
Dataset has been downloaded and looked over.
- Dataset is made up entirely of double or float datatypes (numerical datatype with a single decimal)
- We believe the time is relative to start and that 1 = 1 minute
- The longest time from start is 20.6 hours and as such we assume the problem is for one days delivery
- Details we've been able to extract from the dataset that is needed for PSO and ACO
  - Location data
    - XCORD.
    - YCORD.
  - The amount of goods / demand
    - DEMAND
  - Vehicle capacity
    - 200
  - Amount of vehicles
    - 25
  - Service time
    - SERVICE TIME
  - Time window
    - READY TIME
    - DUE DATE



Update on problem 4
Team lead did not participate in meeting.



Next meeting:
Next meeting was decided to be within 8 days, but a date was not decided yet as we're not sure what the agenda would be.
Problem 2, and problem 3 has yet to have a proper implementation attempt, team lead for problem 4 didn't attend meeting.
We intend to have next meeting after all problems have proper first implementation attempted to have more fruitful discussion.
