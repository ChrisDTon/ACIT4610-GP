Meeting Notes:

Update on problem 2



Update on problem 3
Lecture on swarm was moved to 11.10.2024, and so Christer-Daniel has yet to comprehend how PSO and ACO properly works, and implementing them will be put off till next week.
Dataset has been downloaded and looked over.
- Dataset is made up entirely of double or float datatypes (numerical datatype with a single decimal)
- We believe the time is relative to start and that 1 = 1 minute
- The longest time from start is 20.6 hours and as such we assume the problem is for one days delivery
- Details we've been able to extract from the dataset that is needed for PSO and ACO
  - Location data
    - XCORD.
    - YCORD.
  - The amount of goods / demand
    - DEMAND
  - Service time
    - SERVICE TIME
  - Time window
    - READY TIME
    - DUE DATE
  - Vehicle capacity
    - Missing from dataset**
