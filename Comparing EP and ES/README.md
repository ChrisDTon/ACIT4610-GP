# Comparing EP and ES

## Steps to using each script:
* Tweak the variables in the second row of each version
* Run all rows
* The algorithms are already ran and you can see at the bottom each graph, return and some other values.

When ran the graph is shown at the bottom and stored in the results folder.

The data folder contains the raw csv files as well as the monthly returns.
There is also a script that shows how we processed each csv file and created the monthlyreturns file.
The statisticscalc.py contains the functions for making the graph and calculating the convergence for each Version
